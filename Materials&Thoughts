Thoughts

1. Bias on sample population - compare MISC industrial classification/percentage from SP500 vs sample.

2. Survival bias - CEOs who don't have twitter account:

-   tend to be less modernized people => less wisdom on current market, probably owning a sunset industry
OR  more focused on management => better corporate efficiency
OR  do not have leisure time to run social media => business is in a swamp


IMPACT on long-term SP500 index

%ppl in CEOs who have twitter account ? how to quantify..
