SP500's CEO:                join table with wikipedia> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chief_executive_officers

# Thoughts

1. Bias on sample population - compare MISC industrial classification/percentage from SP500 vs sample.

2. Survival bias - CEOs who don't have twitter account:

-   tend to be less modernized people => less wisdom on current market, probably owning a sunset industry
OR  more focused on management => better corporate efficiency
OR  do not have leisure time to run social media => business is in a swamp


IMPACT on long-term SP500 index

%ppl in CEOs who have twitter account ? how to quantify..


3. Crawling CEO names:

simulate clicks:

> Wikipedia > SEC filings link > if (contains 10K file) {click} else {click [next40]button on lower right}  ...
... > OPEN txt file > SEARCH "POWER OF ATTORNEY" with no "(included" followed within 20 characters ...
... > find the name corresponding to the rows with Chief Executive Officer ...
<div> block  ||  <td> block, how to deal with this?
